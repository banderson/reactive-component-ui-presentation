<em style="font-size: 80%">"Purely <strong>functional code makes some things easier to understand</strong>: because values don't change, you can call functions and know that only their return value matters—they don't change anything outside themselves. <strong>But this makes many real-world applications difficult: how do you write to a database</strong>, or to the screen?"</em>
